Traditional Sourdough Bread Recipe
Making authentic sourdough bread is both an art and a science, requiring patience and attention to detail. This recipe will guide you through creating a rustic loaf with that distinctive tangy flavor and chewy crust characteristic of traditional sourdough.
For the Levain (Starter):

100g mature sourdough starter
100g whole wheat flour
100g water at room temperature

For the Main Dough:

400g bread flour
100g whole wheat flour
350g water
10g salt
All of the levain mixture

Instructions:

Begin by preparing your levain. Mix the starter, flour, and water in a clean container. Let it ferment at room temperature for 4-6 hours, or until it doubles in size and shows plenty of bubbles.
When the levain is ready, combine all the main dough ingredients except the salt. Mix until no dry flour remains. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes (autolyse).
Add the salt and incorporate it throughout the dough by squeezing and folding. Begin the bulk fermentation process, which will take 4-6 hours depending on room temperature.
During bulk fermentation, perform 4-6 sets of stretch and folds at 30-minute intervals. The dough should become stronger and more cohesive with each fold.
Shape the dough gently into a boule or batard. Place in a floured banneton basket, seam side up.
Cover and refrigerate overnight (12-15 hours) for the final proof.

Tips for Success:

Maintain consistent temperatures throughout the process
Handle the dough gently to preserve air bubbles
Use high-protein bread flour for better structure
Watch the dough, not the clock - fermentation times may vary
